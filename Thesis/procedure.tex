\section{ToF Analysis of Cell at Rest in Uncontrolled Environment}

\todo{section title}
\todo{insert plots?}
Attempt to detect TOF without controlling temperature; noise overwhelming
    
    
\section{Acoustic observation of Cell at Rest in Thermal Chamber}

\todo{insert plots?}
    evaluate noise levels in "constant" temperature (uncooled), "constant" pressure environment, while the cell is at rest
    
    Once the ToF stabalized, bump in temperature corresponded with bump in ToF shift.

    
\section{Acoustic observation of cycling cell in thermal chamber}
\todo{insert plots?}
    acoustic signal looked fine, so maintain those conditions and introduce cycling; attempt to 
    
    
\section{Attempting to Acoustically Observe Lithium Plating of Cycling Cell in Thermal Chamber}
\todo{insert plots?}
    cycle the battery at progressively more aggressive charging rates until lithium plating has been forced; attempt to see lithium plating via acoustic ToF shifts
    
\section{X-Ray PhotoElectron Spectroscopy analysis of Cell}
    to Independently Determine Extent of Lithium Plating
