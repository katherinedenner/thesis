\section{Motivation}
Increasing demand for electric vehicles is pushing the need for extreme fast charge capabilities in lithium battery chemistries, and a critical limiting factor in charging rates is lithium deposition \cite{XFC}. Charging a lithium battery too quickly causes lithium deposition, which reduces cell capacity and could create safety hazards \cite{XFC}. Currently, there is no practical in operando method of detecting lithium deposition, so it must be avoided using indirect methods. Being able to monitor lithium plating would allow battery management systems for lithium cells to more accurately control charging rates, and potentially even employ charge and discharge protocols that unplate lithium.

The objective of this thesis is to use ultrasonic methods to demonstrate the feasibility of detecting the deposition of lithium and determining changes in the state of charge and state of health of single layer, high-rate lithium ion cells.
