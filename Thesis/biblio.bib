        "The high and medium stack pressure cells exhibit stress relaxation spanning time scales on the order of days." (746)
        "Changes in the initial stack pressure have a profound effect on the nature of the subsequent stress evolution in the cell." (747)
        "The ephemeral nature of the initial applied stress makes initial stress a somewhat arbitrary designation of stack pressure. Better descriptions of stack pressure can be given by minimum, maximum and/or average stress values" (747)
        "The higher capacity retention exhibited by the low stack pressure cells over the unconstrained cells shows that a small amount of compression is indeed beneficial for long term cell performance." (748)
        "One clear visual trend is that there exists a solid surface film on the anodes taken from the constrained cells, with the cells constrained at a higher stack pressure showing larger regions of film coverage. The film can be seen on the anodes and to a lesser extent on the separator face that was in contact with the anodes. The silver-colored portions of the cathodes are regions where the cathode material adhered to the separator and delaminated from the cathode during disassembly, not regions covered with a surface film."

abstract ={A Li-ion cell does not contain metallic lithium under normal conditions of operation.  Under strenuous charge conditions, however, metallic lithium may deposit on the carbon anode in preference to lithium intercalation and may cause problems in terms of performance, reliability and safety of the cell. Factors that affect the anode polarization and also Li intercalation kinetics play a crucial role in determining the propensity for such lithium deposition.  Such factors include the nature of electrolyte, anode/cathode capacity ration, which have been studied with specific examples here.  Further, various prototype cells from different manufacturers have been examined for their susceptibility towards lithium plating from a set of systematic charge/discharge tests at different charge rates and temperatures.},

abstract ={The expansion of battery material during lithium intercalation is a concern for the cycle life and performance of lithium ion batteries. In this paper, electrode expansion is quantified from in situ neutron images taken during cycling of pouch cells with lithium iron phosphate positive and graphite negative electrodes. Apart from confirming the overall expansion as a function of state of charge and the correlation with graphite transitions that have been observed in previous dilatometer experiments we show the spatial distribution of the expansion along the individual electrodes of the pouch cell. The experiments were performed on two cells with different electrode areas during low and high c-rate operation. The measurements show how charging straightened the cell layers that were slightly curved by handling of the pouch cell during setup of the experiment. Subsequent high charging rate, that exceeded the suggested operating voltage limits, was shown to have a strong influence on the observed expansion. Specifically, during high-rate cycling, the battery showed a much larger and irreversible expansion of around 1.5\% which was correlated with a 4\% loss in capacity over 21 cycles.},
