abstract ={Ultrasonic analysis was used to predict the state of charge and state of health of lithium-ion pouch cells that have been cycled for several hundred cycles. The repeatable ultrasonic trends are reduced to two key metrics: time of flight shift and total signal amplitude, which are then used with voltage data in a supervised machine learning technique to build a model for state of charge (SOC) prediction. Using this model, cell SOC is predicted to ∼1\% accuracy for both lithium cobalt oxide and lithium iron phosphate cells. Elastic wave propagation theory is used to explain that the changes in ultrasonic signal are related to changes in the material properties of the active materials (i.e., elastic modulus and density) during cycling. Finally, we show the machine learning model can accurately predict cell state of health with an error ∼1\%. This is accomplished by extending the data inputs into the model to include full ultrasonic waveforms at top of charge.},

abstract ={Using an ultrasonic flaw detector, electrochemical-acoustic time of flight (EAToF) experiments are performed on commercially available alkaline Zn/MnO2 LR6 (AA) batteries during discharge. The EAToF data are compared to in situ energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDXRD) data and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images taken post mortem. Changes in the acoustic waveforms from EAToF measurements are shown to correlate with dehydration of the Zn gel anode and formation of ZnO, as shown by peak evolution in the EDXRD data and morphology analysis using SEM. We show that the physical transitions during discharge change the transmission of an ultrasonic pulse, and that ultrasonic time-of-flight analysis can be used to determine differences between brands of alkaline AA cells.},

abstract  ="We demonstrate that a simple acoustic time-of-flight experiment can measure the state of charge and state of health of almost any closed battery. An acoustic conservation law model describing the state of charge of a standard battery is proposed{,} and experimental acoustic results verify the simulated trends; furthermore{,} a framework relating changes in sound speed{,} via density and modulus changes{,} to state of charge and state of health within a battery is discussed. Regardless of the chemistry{,} the distribution of density within a battery must change as a function of state of charge and{,} along with density{,} the bulk moduli of the anode and cathode changes as well. The shifts in density and modulus also change the acoustic attenuation in a battery. Experimental results indicating both state-of-charge determination and irreversible physical changes are presented for two of the most ubiquitous batteries in the world{,} the lithium-ion 18650 and the alkaline LR6 (AA). Overall{,} a one- or two-point acoustic measurement can be related to the interaction of a pressure wave at multiple discrete interfaces within a battery{,} which in turn provides insights into state of charge{,} state of health{,} and mechanical evolution/degradation."

abstract = "The effects of mechanical stress on lithium-ion battery life are investigated by monitoring the stack pressure and capacity of constrained commercial lithium-ion pouch cells during cycling. Stack stress is found to be a dynamic quantity, fluctuating with charge/discharge and gradually increasing irreversibly over long times with cycling. Variations in initial stack pressure, an important controllable manufacturing parameter, are shown to produce different stress evolution characteristics over the lifetime of the cells. Cells manufactured with higher levels of stack pressure are found to exhibit shorter cycle lives, although small amounts of stack pressure lead to increased capacity retention over unconstrained cells. Postmortem analysis of these cells suggests a coupling between mechanics and electrochemistry in which higher levels of mechanical stress lead to higher rates of chemical degradation, while layer delamination is responsible for the capacity fade in unconstrained cells. Localized separator deformation resulting in nonuniform lithium transport is also observed in all cells."

abstract ={A Li-ion cell does not contain metallic lithium under normal conditions of operation.  Under strenuous charge conditions, however, metallic lithium may deposit on the carbon anode in preference to lithium intercalation and may cause problems in terms of performance, reliability and safety of the cell. Factors that affect the anode polarization and also Li intercalation kinetics play a crucial role in determining the propensity for such lithium deposition.  Such factors include the nature of electrolyte, anode/cathode capacity ration, which have been studied with specific examples here.  Further, various prototype cells from different manufacturers have been examined for their susceptibility towards lithium plating from a set of systematic charge/discharge tests at different charge rates and temperatures.},

abstract ={The expansion of battery material during lithium intercalation is a concern for the cycle life and performance of lithium ion batteries. In this paper, electrode expansion is quantified from in situ neutron images taken during cycling of pouch cells with lithium iron phosphate positive and graphite negative electrodes. Apart from confirming the overall expansion as a function of state of charge and the correlation with graphite transitions that have been observed in previous dilatometer experiments we show the spatial distribution of the expansion along the individual electrodes of the pouch cell. The experiments were performed on two cells with different electrode areas during low and high c-rate operation. The measurements show how charging straightened the cell layers that were slightly curved by handling of the pouch cell during setup of the experiment. Subsequent high charging rate, that exceeded the suggested operating voltage limits, was shown to have a strong influence on the observed expansion. Specifically, during high-rate cycling, the battery showed a much larger and irreversible expansion of around 1.5\% which was correlated with a 4\% loss in capacity over 21 cycles.},
