    notes ={
        "The high and medium stack pressure cells exhibit stress relaxation spanning time scales on the order of days." (746)
        "Changes in the initial stack pressure have a profound effect on the nature of the subsequent stress evolution in the cell." (747)
        "The ephemeral nature of the initial applied stress makes initial stress a somewhat arbitrary designation of stack pressure. Better descriptions of stack pressure can be given by minimum, maximum and/or average stress values" (747)
        "The higher capacity retention exhibited by the low stack pressure cells over the unconstrained cells shows that a small amount of compression is indeed beneficial for long term cell performance." (748)
        "One clear visual trend is that there exists a solid surface film on the anodes taken from the constrained cells, with the cells constrained at a higher stack pressure showing larger regions of film coverage. The film can be seen on the anodes and to a lesser extent on the separator face that was in contact with the anodes. The silver-colored portions of the cathodes are regions where the cathode material adhered to the separator and delaminated from the cathode during disassembly, not regions covered with a surface film."
