	Abstract = {Simulated annealing is a randomized algorithm which has been proposed for finding globally optimum least-cost configurations in large NP-complete problems with cost functions which may have many local minima. A theoretical analysis of simulated annealing based on its precise model, a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain, is presented. An annealing schedule is given for which the Markov chain is strongly ergodic and the algorithm converges to a global optimum. The finite-time behavior of simulated annealing is also analyzed and a bound obtained on the departure of the probability distribution of the state at finite time from the optimum. This bound gives an estimate of the rate of convergence and insights into the conditions on the annealing schedule which gives optimum performance.},
