This thesis demonstrates the capability of acoustic time of flight analysis to observe changes in the state of charge and state of health in a fast-charge lithium-ion cell, and even to observe changes in the cell's ambient temperature. Described within is: the design of an experimental apparatus was designed and produced that would allow for electrically manipulating the lithium-ion cell's state of charge and state of health while regulating its ambient temperature and pressure; the experimental procedures used to explore the validity of these acoustic time of flight techniques to lithium-ion fast-charge cells; and the data analysis used to synthesize and interpret acoustical, electrochemical, and thermal data.
