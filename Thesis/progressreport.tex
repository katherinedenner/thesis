\chapter{Progress Report}

\section{Work completed}
So far I have designed the apparatus for the experiment, manufactured the custom parts and purchased off-the-shelf components, and am finishing up setting-up the apparatus. Some of this work has been documented in the following pages, particularly apparatus requirements and considerations, as well as a description of the design. 

\section{Work remaining}
Once the apparatus is completed, it must be validated using known test articles. Following that, data collection can begin using test protocols that have already been proven in the PLEESR lab, ideally requiring minimal modifications. With modifications, the apparatus could even be remounted inside a freezer to allow for further lithium-plating experimentation. Once the data is collected, it must of course be analyzed. This analysis will lean on prior work done by the lab such as \cite{ANODE-CHAR} \cite{SOC-SOH-EST} \cite{TOF-STATE}.
